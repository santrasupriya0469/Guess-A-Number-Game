Guess A Number Game

Guess the number is a classic game where one person (or a computer) thinks of a secret number and the other person tries to guess it. The guesser makes attempts, and after each guess, they are told if their guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the guesser correctly identifies the secret number.  It's a fun way to practice logic and deduction skills!
